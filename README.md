## Stakeboard

Stakeboard is a distributed application built by and for stakepool operators and delegators to connect one to another and discover the world behind the projects in the Cardano Ecosystem.

Stakeboard give you insight about stakepools which are running on the Cardano ecosystem and in the future more various dPos blockchains, contributions done within the ecosystem and investment opportunities into new upcoming projects launching within a fast paced innovative space.

No need to research stakepool operators or initial Stakepool offerings as Stakeboard has it all covered. We bring you the latest news regarding stakepools as operators can directly communicate and update their profiles and details on the platform as well as publish articles, link videos and share knowledge regarding the Cardano ecosystem.

To answer why Stakeboard is an important platform for this space we have a couple of questions listed below.
